      <h2>Rules:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by
          under-population
        </li>
        <li>
          any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next
          generation
        </li>
        <li>
          any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by
          overpopulation
        </li>
        <li>
          any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell,
          as if by reproduction
        </li>
      </ul>
